Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. They allow you to control the flow of your program by evaluating conditions and executing code accordingly. The main types of conditional statements in JavaScript are the if statement, the if...else statement, the if...else if...else statement, and the switch statement.

1. if Statement:
The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

Example:
let hour = 15;
if (hour < 18) {
    console.log("Good day!");
}


2. if...else Statement:
The if...else statement executes one block of code if a specified condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

Example:
let hour = 22;
if (hour < 18) {
    console.log("Good day!");
} else {
    console.log("Good evening!");
}


3. if...else if...else Statement:
The if...else if...else statement allows you to test multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the first condition that is true.
Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}

Example:
let time = 20;
if (time < 12) {
    console.log("Good morning!");
} else if (time < 18) {
    console.log("Good afternoon!");
} else {
    console.log("Good evening!");
}

4. switch Statement:
The switch statement allows you to test a value against multiple cases and execute different blocks of code based on the matched case.
Syntax:
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}

Example:
let day = 2;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Other day");
}
